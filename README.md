# FlightDesk
A constantly evolving setup for controlling Elite Dangerous using DIY controllers for ultimate immersion.

# Software
 - Elite Dangerous (obviously)
 - Arduino
   - [Custom firmware](http://mitchtech.net/arduino-usb-hid-keyboard/) to allow it take act as a USB HID device
 - [OnTopReplica](https://ontopreplica.codeplex.com/) to allow mirroring of certain sections of screens and other screens
 - [PowerGrid](http://www.roccat.org/en-US/Products/Gaming-Software/Power-Grid/Home/) for Android App Control
 - [Google Play Music Desktop Player](https://www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com/) for custom music
 - [SCP Toolkit](https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit) for utilizing PS3 controller as Xbox Controller on PC
 
# Hardware
 - PS3 Controller
 - Arduino

# Inspiration
 - [Simpit](https://www.simplicate.info/tag/joystick/), just holy shit look at this!
 
# Overall Plan
 1.) I want to setup a custom built controller with switches and buttons with pretty LEDs and stuff that can be multi-pupose.
 2.) Would like to replicate the in-game cockpit as much as possible
 3.) Eventually probably replace the gamepad with a joystick and throttle control but I may not because I really like the gamepad.  Not sure if I would like a joystick as much.  Would be nice to have a spare hand.
